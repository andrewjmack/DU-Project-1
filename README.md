# DU-Project-1: Beer Analysis
Collaborative repository for the first project for the spring 2024 cohort of the University of Denver Data Analytics & Visualization

## Summary:
This repo contains the files related to an analysis of unique beers and their ratings on the popular social site BeerAdvocate.com.

Details on the contents and references utilized are further below, but the core analysis can be found in the "beer_analysis" "Jupyter notebook and the initial cleaning of the data set and exploratory data analysis ("EDA") in the "beer_EDA_cleanup" notebook.

A presentation was also created (based on the analysis and included herein as a PDF file). The chart source images contained within the Outputs folder. This folder also contains the working data file for analysis that resulted from the cleaning process.

The Resources folder contains the original source dataset as well as a reference file for keywords counted in the middle columns of the set (which were not ultimately used in the analysis).
